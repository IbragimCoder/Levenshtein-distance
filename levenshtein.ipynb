Each cell `dp[i][j]` stores the minimum number of operations (**insertion**, **deletion**, **substitution**) required to transform the substring `str_1[0..i-1]` into `str_2[0..j-1]`. This represents the Levenshtein distance between the first `i` characters of `str_1` and the first `j` characters of `str_2`.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Memory Efficiency:**\n",
    "   - Instead of storing an entire `(n+1) x (m+1)` matrix, the optimized method uses only two arrays: `previous_row` and `current_row`.\n",
    "   - This is especially beneficial when one of the strings is significantly longer than the other.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Swapping Strings:**\n",
    "   - To further minimize memory usage, the algorithm swaps `str_1` and `str_2` if `n > m`. This ensures that the `current_row` array is as small as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Same Time Complexity:**\n",
    "   - The time complexity remains **O(n*m)**, the same as the classical method, but with reduced memory overhead.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Time Complexity: O(n*m)\n",
    "\n",
    "The time complexity of the algorithm is **O(n*m)** because:\n",
    "- We iterate over each character of `str_2` (length `m`).\n",

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the test results:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Both implementations** (classical and optimized) produce **the same results** for all test cases, confirming their correctness.\n",
    "2. The **optimized version** is **faster** and uses **less memory** compared to the classical version, especially for large inputs.\n",
    "3. The **classical version** is easier to understand but is **less efficient** in terms of memory usage.\n",
    "4. The **optimized version** is better for large datasets or memory-constrained environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the optimized method is **recommended** for practical use due to its efficiency, while the classical method is useful for learning and understanding the algorithm."
