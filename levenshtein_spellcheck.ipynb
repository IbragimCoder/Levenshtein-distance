    "# Spell Checker with Levenshtein Distance\n",
    "\n",
    "This code is a **spell checker** that uses the **Levenshtein distance** algorithm to find and suggest corrections for misspelled words. It loads a dictionary of words from a file, checks if a given word is in the dictionary, and suggests similar words if the word is not found.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Code Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The code consists of the following main parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Importing Required Modules:**\n",
    "   - The necessary modules (`typing`) and the `optimized_levenshtein_distance` function are imported.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Loading the Dictionary:**\n",
    "   - A function to load a dictionary of words from a file and check if it is empty.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Finding Suggestions:**\n",
    "   - A function to find the most similar words from the dictionary based on the Levenshtein distance.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Spell Checking:**\n",
    "   - A function to check if a word is in the dictionary and suggest corrections if it is not found.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Main Function:**\n",
    "   - The main function that loads the dictionary, takes user input, and performs the spell check."

    "\n",
    "This function finds words from the dictionary that are similar to the input word using the Levenshtein distance.\n",
    "\n",
    "####\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`max_suggestions: int = 5`**: This decides how many word suggestions the function gives you. The default is 5, so it gives 5 suggestions. You can change it to get more or fewer suggestions.\n",
    "- **`max_distance: int = 3`**: This is the biggest difference allowed between words to call them similar. The default is 3, meaning up to 3 changes (like adding, removing, or changing a letter). You can change this number.\n",
    "- **`distances = [(dict_word, optimized_levenshtein_distance(word, dict_word)) for dict_word in dictionary]`**: This makes a list called `distances`. The list has pairs: each word from the dictionary (`dict_word`) and how different it is from the word you entered (`word`). The difference is called the Levenshtein distance.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Why Sorting Helps `distances = sorted(distances, key=lambda x: (x[1], x[0]))`\n",
    "- Sorting by distance puts the most similar words at the start. For example, if \"cat\" is 1 step away from \"cot\" and 2 steps away from \"dog,\" \"cot\" will be first because it’s closer.\n",
    "- Sorting alphabetically helps when distances are the same. For example, if \"cot\" and \"cut\" both have a distance of 1, \"cot\" comes before \"cut\" because of the alphabet.\n",
    "- This makes it easier to pick the best suggestions when we take the top `max_suggestions` words.\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Example\n",
    "- Before sorting: `[(\"dog\", 2), (\"cot\", 1), (\"cut\", 1)]`\n",
    "- After sorting: `[(\"cot\", 1), (\"cut\", 1), (\"dog\", 2)]`\n",
    "- This shows \"cot\" and \"cut\" are the closest to your word, and \"cot\" is first because it starts with \"c,\" which is before \"d\" in the alphabet.\n",
    "\n",
    "In short, sorting helps the function give you the best and most organized word suggestions.\n",
